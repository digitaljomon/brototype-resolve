#🛠️ How Category-wise Admins Use the App

Category Admins only handle complaints related to their assigned domain (Tech, Course, Infrastructure, Billing, Anti-Ragging, Administration, Mentor, etc.).
What Category Admins Can Do:
View complaints in their assigned category only
Update complaint status
Reply to student messages
Handle complaints within the deadlines assigned by the Super Admin
View only the data allowed for their category
Category Admin Login Accounts
(All use the same password: 12345678)
Admin Role	Username
Tech Admin	techadmin@gmail.com
Course Admin	courseadmin@gmail.com
Infrastructure Admin	infraadmin@gmail.com
Billing Admin	billingsadmin@gmail.com
Anti-Ragging Admin	antiraggingadmin@gmail.com
Administration Admin	administration@gmail.com

Across every category and student.
✔ Assign complaints
Super Admin decides which category admin will handle each complaint.
✔ Manage categories
Add, edit, or remove complaint categories as needed.
✔ Manage Category Admins
Add new admins, remove admins, or reassign categories.
✔ Set deadlines & SLAs
Super Admin can set how quickly each type of complaint must be resolved.
✔ View analytics & insights
Super Admin dashboard includes trends, category distribution, and daily activity insights.
The Super Admin ensures smooth operation and quick resolutions across the entire system.

#🧭 How the App Should Be Used (Simple Workflow)
Student Side

Login → Dashboard

Submit complaint

Wait for verification

Receive messages from admin

Track status until resolved

Review final resolution

#Admin Side (Category Admin)

Login → Category Dashboard

View category-specific complaints

Update status / respond to students

Resolve complaint within deadline

#Super Admin Flow

Login → Full System Dashboard

Monitor all complaints

Manage categories & admins

Assign complaints to the right admin

#🎨 Why This App Stands Out

Clean, fast, and intuitive interface

Clear separation of roles

Real-time communication

Deadline/SLA-driven system

Professional sidebar dashboard layout

Competition-ready architecture

Realistic, practical features used in real institutions

#🧪 How to Test Everything End-to-End

Login as student → submit a complaint

Login as super admin → assign that complaint to a category admin

Login as the assigned category admin → update progress & message student

Switch back to student → watch status change & respond

Track the entire life cycle until resolution

This demonstrates the complete workflow perfectly.
